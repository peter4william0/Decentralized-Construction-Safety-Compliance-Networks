# Decentralized Construction Safety Compliance Networks

A comprehensive blockchain-based system for managing construction safety compliance using Clarity smart contracts on the Stacks blockchain.

## Overview

This project implements a decentralized network for construction safety compliance management, featuring five interconnected smart contracts that handle different aspects of construction safety:

- **Safety Coordinator Verification**: Manages registration and verification of safety coordinators
- **Incident Tracking**: Records and tracks safety incidents across construction sites
- **Training Management**: Handles safety training programs and worker certifications
- **Compliance Monitoring**: Monitors overall safety compliance across construction sites
- **Risk Assessment**: Manages construction risk assessments and mitigation plans

## Features

### üîê Safety Coordinator Verification
- Register and verify safety coordinators
- Track coordinator credentials and certifications
- Manage coordinator status and compliance scores
- Prevent unauthorized access to safety systems

### üìä Incident Tracking
- Report safety incidents with detailed information
- Track incident severity levels (1-5 scale)
- Update incident status and resolutions
- Generate incident statistics and reports

### üéì Training Management
- Create and manage safety training programs
- Enroll workers in training courses
- Track training completion and scores
- Issue digital certificates for qualified workers

### üìà Compliance Monitoring
- Register and monitor construction sites
- Conduct compliance checks and inspections
- Track compliance scores and violations
- Identify non-compliant sites requiring attention

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Risk Assessment
- Create comprehensive risk assessments
- Categorize and rate risk levels
- Develop mitigation plans
- Track critical risks across sites

### Data Flow
1. **Coordinators** are verified through the Safety Coordinator contract
2. **Incidents** are reported and tracked with coordinator oversight
3. **Training** programs ensure worker competency
4. **Compliance** monitoring tracks overall site safety
5. **Risk assessments** identify and mitigate potential hazards
